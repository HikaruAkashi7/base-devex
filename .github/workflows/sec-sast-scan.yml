# WORKFLOW: Security SAST Scan
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   Performs Static Application Security Testing (SAST) using Semgrep to
#   detect security vulnerabilities, bugs, and code quality issues in
#   the source code. This workflow:
#   1. Runs Semgrep with auto-configuration to detect common security issues
#   2. Fails the workflow if any security findings are detected
#
#   Semgrep uses a container-based approach and automatically detects
#   programming languages and applies relevant security rules.
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#   1. Repository must have source code to scan
#   2. Repository must have appropriate permissions for security-events
#
# SCAN SETTINGS:
#   - config: 'auto' (automatically detects languages and applies rules)
#   - error: Fails the workflow if any findings are detected
