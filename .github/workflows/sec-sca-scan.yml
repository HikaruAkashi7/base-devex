# WORKFLOW: Security SCA Scan
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   Performs Software Composition Analysis (SCA) using Trivy to detect
#   vulnerabilities in project dependencies and package files. This workflow:
#   1. Scans the filesystem for dependency files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
#   2. Identifies known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies
#   3. Reports critical vulnerabilities and fails if any are found
#
#   Trivy automatically detects dependency files and scans them for known
#   Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#   1. Repository must contain dependency files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
#   2. Repository must have appropriate permissions for security-events
#
# SCAN SETTINGS:
#   - scan-type: 'fs' (filesystem scan)
#   - scan-ref: '.' (scans the entire repository)
#   - severity: 'CRITICAL' (only critical vulnerabilities fail the workflow)
#   - ignore-unfixed: true (ignores vulnerabilities without fixes)
